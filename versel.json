## Also Make Sure apply.html is in the Right Place

Your built site serves files from the `dist` folder after Vite compiles everything. Files in `src` are NOT served directly.

Check this — in your GitHub repo root, do you see `apply.html` at the **top level** alongside `index.html`? 

Not inside `src/` — at the very root like this:
```
creatoros-website/
├── apply.html        ← needs to be HERE
├── index.html        
├── vercel.json       ← add this
├── src/
├── package.json
